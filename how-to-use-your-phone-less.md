## 1. Intro
You can probably relate to the feeling of doom scrolling, panicking inside and yet not being able to stop. Or you can't. Anyhow, in this blog I'll explain some methods that I've discovered that have helped me reduce my screen time and avoid app addiction, and improve my productivity and wellbeing.

<a name='separation'></a>
## 2. Separation of work and play
One of the best tips I've got (but they're all great), is to separate your work and play environments. By this I mean to have 2 places where you have your different apps that you use for work/communication, and entertainment. It could be a bit tricky to separate entartainment apps that are also used for communication, but I'm sure you could transition to a purely communications app (Signal? Anyone?).

### Two phones
This can be done in various ways, depending on your circumstances. Probably the best way, if you have a spare phone, is to use one phone for work, and the other for play. One advantage of this method is that it allows you to put your entertainment phone in hard-to-reach places, thus making you less likely to grab it impulsively. Plus you won't be distracted by it as easily (out of sight, out of mind). 

(Alternatively if you have the money, you could find a cheap used phone to serve as your entertainment device - doesn't have to be top-of-the-line)

### Two accounts
If you don't have the luxury of a secondary device, you could setup another user account on your current phone, where you can install all of your time-wasting apps. Having them on the secondary account adds a defensive layer, you have to think in order to reach those apps, so you can stop yourself more easily when you have an impulse to check an app.

Setting up another user can be done easily on Android, but I'm not sure if it's possible on iOS. You can probably find lots of guides online on how to do it for your device. ([One such guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/333484/how-to-set-up-multiple-user-profiles-on-android/))


*extra tip!*

If you set up 2 accounts on your phone, after a while, you might get used to switching between the accounts, and find yourself mindlessly scrolling again. For this, I have a temporary solution, which you can also use for days when you want to make sure that you won't procrastinate:

* remove any secondary authentication methods from the 2nd account, and leave only the PIN

* write on a piece of paper a long number (10+ digits)

* set the number as your password on the secondary account

* hide away the piece of paper with the password (but don't lose it! :) )

## 3. Limit your exposure
Many times what makes us do something is just a visual reminder. Your home screen is a place full of these triggers, apps everywhere trying to remind you of their existence. But it won't work if you remove them.

### Input based launchers

<a name='android'></a> 
#### Android
On top of the previous method, I would also suggest that you try the KISS launcher ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.neamar.kiss) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/)) or [Sentient launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sentienhq.launcher&gl=US) (which is a KISS clone pretty much, the first I found, and not sure if there's a difference in features). 

Make sure to explore the settings and make it more usable for you.

These launchers are basically a single search bar on your screen, and you can search for anything on your phone. This way, when you open your phone you are not instantly cued by the UI to open your favourite apps out of habit, and you have to actually type what you want, and you can go into your phone with a goal in mind and not get side-tracked. (again, out of sight, out of mind)

<a name='ios'></a> 
#### iOS
Unfortunately I don't know of any iOS alternatives. What you could do instead, is to remove all the apps from the home screen, and just use the search feature to get to apps. (if anyone knows of such a launcher on iOS, pleas send it to anyhow42 at protonmail dot com)


*another extra tip!*

You could add to your home screen a to-do app widget, so you can focus more on tasks at hand. For this I would recommend Habitica ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habitrpg.android.habitica) **AND** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitica-gamified-task-manager/id994882113?mt=8)), which is a neat app that gamifies completing tasks.

## 4. Reducing your app usage
This section describes some methods and apps that I use that allowed me to reduce my usage of certain apps 
<a name='np'></a>
### Use NewPipe 
I love [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/). It does everything you wished YouTube did. No ads, plays in the background, easily escape recommended videos, no more YT rabbitholes. It is basically a free YouTube client that you can download from the link above, on Android (I'm sorry iOS users, I don't know of iOS alternatives for the methods and apps that I shared. If anyone does, please send them to me at anyhow42 at protonmail dot com, so I can update this blog).

This app has basically allowed me to drastically reduce my YouTube watch time. I imported my subscriptions from YouTube, and NewPipe has a tab called "What's new" where you can only see videos posted by the channels that you are subscribed to. The key thing is to stick to this list, and avoid recommended videos, which NewPipe lets you ignore more easily, since under videos playing there is a separate tab for comments, recommended, and description. Just saty clear of the recommended tab.

I should also point out that NewPipe lets you customise the main page, which by default is the 'Trending' tab. You can go to **Top left menu** > **Settings** > **Content** > **Content of main page** and find there the current main page tabs, which you can remove by swiping them away, and add new ones with the "+" button at the botton right. This way you will have your main channels on the main page and you won't be distracted by other videos.

<a name='u/i'></a> 
### Uninstall apps
This is a no-brainer, but if you really want to reduce your usage, or consider taht an app is waisting too much of your time, you should consider uninstalling it (\**cough*\* TikTok \**cough*\*).

Take this occasion to also look through all your apps, and ask yourself for each of them if you really need it.

<a name='awareness'></a>
## 5. Be aware of design patterns
It's no secret that all of these entertainment and social media apps are designed to be addictive. The companies want you to spend as much time as possible on them. But being aware of these patterns will help you identify them and hopefully not fall easily for them, since you now know that it means certain procrastination (*let's go, in and out, 20 minutes adventure*...).

Below are some common design patterns that various apps use to try and keep users scrolling, watching, posting etc...

<a name='action'></a>
### Making it easy for you to take action
This is a pretty basic one, and it's just companies putting like/comment/share buttons in the most convenient places, or making it easy to go to the next post/video, to reduce the effort needed to act (think TikTok: all those buttons are on the bottom right side of the screen, where your thumb is)

<a name='nudge'></a>
### Nudging you with new content
Constantly trying to make you watch new content (shorts, reels, clips...).
Some apps recommend you content (YouTube).

Other apps try to 'trick' you into a doom scrolling session. Reddit, for example, tries to make you watch a sequence of videos, since it knows they're more engaging. In previous versions, when you clicked on a video post, and then swiped up, it exited the video player and would send you back to the feed. Now it keeps showing you other videos.

In situations like these I just try to not look at the suggested content, and not engage in TikTok style video viewing (applies to all the other platforms, I stay away from YT shorts, IG reels and similar short clips) since I know that it will catch my attention somehow and I'll be stuck for ages again.

<a name='likes'></a>
### Likes
This is basically an attempt to incentivise users to post. Do you really need those fake internet points? We feel compelled to create content that we know will please the masses (or our following), just to feel like we are accepted in some way, that we're part of a group. But this never leads to sustainable satisfaction, and we risk forgetting what *actually* pleases **us**. We should learn to accept ourselves, and when we post, try to forget about public acceptance, and focus on the content you're creating, and if it is something you deem worth existing. Once you determine that, go make that shitpost on reddit. Do what you like. Forget upvotes. Or downvotes.


There are probably countless other patterns that are not described here, but I think you get the point. Avoid anything that is likely to provide you with excessive (endless) content. Try to get over your fear of missing out on content. Remember a day when you didn't spend that much time on your phone. Did you *really* feel that sorry for having missed out on all those great TikToks and videos on YouTube? I can tell you from experience that if you haven't seen something, you won't remember how good it was and that you missed out on it.
